# Modeling
This is a repository for the modeling projects from my capstone Modeling course at Villanova University. As stated there, this is not meant to be 100% functional code, nor will it necessarily generate every element found in the reports, because the reports represent an accumulation of material. Some of the code is lost completely due to unexpected Ubuntu dual-boot failures. The purpose of the repository is to showcase code that demonstrates my proficiency in Python and the variety of problems I have used it to model, and as a reference for how I approached each report.
